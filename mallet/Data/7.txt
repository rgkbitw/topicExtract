spiritual knowledge. For when even highly learned and thoughtful
men read this meaning into Gita… (CWMG vol. 37: 82)
Gandhi asks ‘what can we expect of ordinary people?’ (CWMG vol. 37: 82).
Let me point out here that though Tilak, his political guru, believed, like
Krishnavarma and Savarkar, that the Gita preached violence, Gandhi does
not include him along with them. He however does refer to Tilak later and
declares his differences with him. Referring to the verse in Gita, ‘Everyone
follow a path which leads to Me’, he says:  
This verse has a history behind it. When Tilak Maharaj was alive, he
had cited this verse in the course of a discussion about violence and
non-violence. I had argued that we should bear with a person who
might have slapped us. In reply, he cites this verse to prove that the
Gita upheld  the  principle  of  ‘tit  for  tat’.  That  is,  we  should  act
towards a person as he acts towards us. I cling to the reply which I
gave to him then. (CWMG vol. 37: 175) 
Gandhi thus makes his stand clear on the issue of the Gita’s stand on non-
violence, with those like Krishnavarma and Savarkar and even his revered
guru, Tilak. He adds, 
If what we describe as the very quintessence of all Shastras — as
one of the Upanishads,  can  be  interpreted  to  yield  such  a  wrong
meaning, it would have been  better,  for  the  holy  Vyasa  to  have
taken another, more effective, illustration  to  teach  sacred  truths
(CWMG vol. 37: 82). 
Tracing the reason behind the readers’ firm conviction in Arjuna and Shri
Krishna  to  Vyasa’s  ‘vivid’  portrayal  of  them,  he  adds,  ‘The  historian-
author,  moreover,  gives histories of  cities,  communities,  and individual
characters, and claims that he is describing a battle in which the best men
of his age took part’.” (CWMG, Vol. 37: p. 82). Reproaching this creative
