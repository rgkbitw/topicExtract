use of  the event to teach great truths’ (CWMG vol.  37: 82).  Given the
tricky nature of the plot and the literary style if the reader is not on ‘his
guard, he may be misled. The very nature of dharma is such that one may
easily fall into error if one is not vigilant’ (CWMG vol. 37: 82).
In  support  of  this  adventurous  interpretation,  he  says  that  the
subject of the Gita is neither a ‘description of the battle’ nor a ‘justification
of  violence’  (CWMG vol.  33:  87).  He then gets  into  debating mode by
saying that ‘it is difficult to reconcile a few of the verses with the idea that
the  Gita  advocates non-violence, it is still more difficult to reconcile the
teaching of the work as a whole with the advocacy of violence’ (CWMG
vol. 33: 87).
In this context Gandhi makes yet another radical move when he
says  that  the  characters  in  the  Gita  cannot  be  taken  as  ‘historical
persons’. Rather, he says: 
I believe that Dhuryodhana and his supporters stand for the Satanic
impulses in us, and Arjuna and others stand for Godly impulses in
us.  The  battle-field  is  our  body.  The  poet-seer,  who  knows  from
experience the problems of life, has given a faithful account of the
conflict which is eternally going on within us. Shri Krishna is the Lord
dwelling in everyone’s heart who is ever murmuring. His prompting
in a pure  chitta, like a clock ticking in a room. If the clock of the
chitta is  not  wound  up  with  the  key  of  self-purification,  the  in-
dwelling Lord no doubt remains where He is, but the ticking is heard
no more. (CWMG vol. 33: 88) 
He extends this further when he says: 
I  do not wish to suggest that violence has no place at all  in the
teaching of the  Gita. The dharma which it teaches does not mean
that a person who has not yet awakened to the truth of non-violence
may  act  like  a  coward.  Anyone  who  fears  others,  accumulates
