claims of truth. Resolving these will be not only difficult but also unviable
as  each  claim  to  their  own  version  of  truth.  The  change  that  Gandhi
embarks on, the swapping that he initiates, removes this obstacle. With
this move God becomes either identical with, or a part of the Truth. This
makes Truth accessible both to those who believe and those who do not,
thus  enormously  extending  the  purview  of  the  domain  of  Truth  and
accomplishing  extensive  inclusions.  There  is  a  need  to  recognize  the
radicalness of this move by Gandhi. While his idea of non-violence has its
roots in classical Indian philosophy, he in a way neutralizes this relation
and brings the concept  into  the centre  stage of  modern society in  an
unusual way, at a remarkable time. But what he does with regard to Truth
is very radical and that tremendously enlarges the domain of Truth.
